## Codename "CBisland" a minimal viable Point&Click Adventure

As part of a PHP course, the task was to create a PHP-project which uses a MySql Database and has a hashed login and register function.

Deliberately, tools like Composer, the PDO extension, Java/Script etc., were omitted.

## Requirements (rules of thumb)
Dynamic web-page with hashed login, user account creation, CSS
- DB: 
  - 2 small tables with master/detail link
  - primary and secondary key definitions
  - relations with referential integrity
- Logic:
  - PHP-programms
  - external included/required functions (helper?)
  - if neccessary JavaScript
- Frontend:
  - HTML for page structure
  - design in external .CSS (because of time constrains no responsive design required)
  - if neccessary JavaScript
  - maybe JavaScript in parts
## Excecution
- Timeframe
  - 10 working days
- ERM and testing "on paper"
- planning of the project structure
- DB creation
  - filling with test data and query testing
- PHP Coding
  - realising DB queries with tes data directly from PHP-Code
- suggested code freeze after 7 days
  - followed by testing and presentation preparations
## Presentation
  - max. 15 min
  - feedback
